# API Demo Project

This project demonstrates how easy it is to integrate with APIs by building a simple application using just a couple of files and a few lines of code. Most of the code is generated by Postman, showcasing the potential of simple tools and example cURL requests.

I hope to inspire people and encourage them in learning about APIs and integration by this project.

## Introduction

APIs are powerful tools that allow applications to communicate with each other. This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate external APIs into a PHP application effortlessly. By leveraging tools like Postman and Composer, and utilizing API keys from Google and OpenAI, you can build powerful applications with minimal code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **PHP**: Installed on your system.
- **Composer**: For dependency management.
- **API Keys**
    - **Google API Key**
    - **OpenAI API Key**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required PHP packages using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Copy the example environment file and rename it:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add Your API Keys**

   Open the `.env` file and insert your API keys:

   ```ini
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the PHP built-in web server to run the application locally:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8081
```

Access the application by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081) in your web browser.
